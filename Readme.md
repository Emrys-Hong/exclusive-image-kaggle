## difficulties
the bigges difficulty lies in the dataset is so BIG(512G), we narrow down the number of classes to fit the model. listed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/basic-eda-with-images)

As the function is multi classification, therefore we need to change our metric to F2 loss function. and change the loss error from softmax to sigmoid.
